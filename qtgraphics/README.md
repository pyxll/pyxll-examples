### Optimization Examples

These examples go with the blog post at

     https://www.pyxll.com/blog/extending-the-excel-user-interface/

In order to have them work correctly you should add the
path of the configuration file in this directory to the value of
the `external_config` setting in your main configuration file's
`[PYXLL]` section.

The optimization function can then be triggered using the
"Optimize" menu item on the "PyXLL" menu on the "Add-Ins"
ribbon.
