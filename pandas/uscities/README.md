# US Cities Pandas Example

This example shows how to efficiently use pandas in Excel to analyse the US Cities data set.
By keeping the data in Python and performing filter and aggregation in Python we keep
the spreadsheet small and simply, while still processing the entire data set.

You will need to download the US Cities Data Set from https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities
in order to use this example. Download and unzip the data set, and then update the path to
the uscities.csv file in the example workbook uscities.xlsx.
