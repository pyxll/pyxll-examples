# Python Plotting in Excel with Matplotlib

**THIS EXAMPLE IS OUT OF DATE**

For details of how to use matplotlib in Excel with PyXLL please refer to the offical PyXLL docs https://www.pyxll.com/docs/userguide/plotting/index.html.

This example pre-dates plotting being added as a feature to PyXLL and should no longer be used, but is intetionally left here in case it is of interest.
The code relies on an old version of pandas and will not work with the latest version.
